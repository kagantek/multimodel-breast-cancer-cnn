        <h2>About This Project</h2>
        <p>
            This project is a part of a graduation thesis focusing on deploying multiple deep learning models
            trained on different medical imaging datasets. Each model is designed to detect abnormalities
            and provide predictive diagnostics for a specific type of medical image: Mammography, Ultrasound, and Histopathology.
        </p>
        <p>
            Users can interact with each model by uploading relevant images and receiving AI-driven predictions
            to support medical decision-making and early diagnosis.
