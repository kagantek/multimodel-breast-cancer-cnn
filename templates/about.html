        <p>
            This graduation project presents a comparative analysis of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) applied to medical imaging data.
            The primary aim is to evaluate the baseline performance of well-known deep learning architectures across three imaging modalities:
            <strong>Mammography</strong>, <strong>Ultrasound</strong>, and <strong>Histopathology</strong>.

                The full dataset contains 55,890 training examples with a class distribution of 14% positive and 86% negative,
                split across 5 TFRecord files. In this project, only 3 TFRecords were used for consistency, totaling <strong>33,851 images</strong> used across all models.

                This dataset contains approximately <strong>9,000 images</strong> with a balanced class distribution. A <strong>70-15-15 split</strong> was used for training, validation, and testing respectively.

        <p>
            To ensure a fair and unbiased model comparison, all models were trained using the exact same hyperparameters and experimental conditions:

        <ul class="list-group list-group-flush bg-dark">
            <li class="list-group-item bg-dark text-light">✅ Identical train/validation/test splits per dataset</li>

        <h4 class="text-primary">Project Objective</h4>
        <p>
            The goal of this project is to establish a clear, apples-to-apples comparison of baseline CNN architectures across different medical imaging tasks.
            This allows for informed model selection in future deep learning systems for diagnostics, and contributes to the literature on performance benchmarking in medical AI.
